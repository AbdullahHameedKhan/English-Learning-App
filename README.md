# English-Learning-App

This repository contains the implementation of an English learning app designed to help users improve their spoken English skills. The app allows users to upload audio recordings of themselves speaking English, which are then analyzed by an advanced algorithm. The algorithm evaluates each word in the recording, providing detailed feedback on pronunciation, accent, and overall speaking proficiency.

# Key Features:

# Audio Analysis: 
The app processes user-uploaded audio files, breaking down the speech into individual words for analysis.
# Pronunciation Correction: 
The algorithm identifies pronunciation errors, offering precise corrections to help users pronounce words more accurately.
# Accent Adjustment: 
The app provides feedback on accent, suggesting modifications to help users achieve a more native-like accent or improve clarity in their speech.
# Comprehensive Feedback: 
In addition to word-level corrections, the app evaluates overall speaking skills, including fluency, intonation, and rhythm, providing users with actionable insights for improvement.

# How It Works:
# Upload Audio: 
Users can record and upload their spoken English via the app.
# Automatic Analysis: 
The uploaded audio is processed by the algorithm, which evaluates the pronunciation, accent, and overall speaking quality.
# Detailed Feedback: 
The app provides a breakdown of errors and suggests corrections for each word, along with general advice on how to improve speaking skills.

# Use Cases:
Language learners looking to improve their English pronunciation and accent.
Non-native English speakers aiming to refine their spoken English for professional or academic purposes.
Educators seeking a tool to provide students with personalized feedback on their speaking skills.
This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to provide personalized language learning experiences, helping users to effectively improve their English speaking abilities.
